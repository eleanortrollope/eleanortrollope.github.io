I am currently a DPhil student in Machine Learning at the University of Oxford as part of the CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines & Systems (AIMS). I am supervised by Prof. Yee-Whye Teh (Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning), Prof. Stephen Roberts (Machine Learning Research Group), and Dr. Tim Rudner (University of Toronto). My research focuses on developing novel AI methods for scientific discovery, with an emphasis on building robust and generalisable learning algorithms. I am particularly interested in generative models for molecular design and drug discovery, with a focus on uncertainty, inductive biases, and reliable generalisation.


Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Before this, I was a UniQ+ DeepMind–funded research intern in the Torr Vision Group at Oxford. This internship marked my return to academia after spending 2.5 years as a quantitative analyst in finance.
